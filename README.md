# X-Spectra

X-Spectra is a Python library designed for the spectral analysis of nitrogen plasma. It provides tools for data processing, spectral simulation, and visualization, making it easier to automate scientific calculations and analyze experimental data.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Filter, normalize, and cut spectral data.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Extract peaks, calculate temperatures (vibrational and rotational), and analyze spectral lines.
- **Simulation**: Generate synthetic spectra using physical models.
- **Visualization**: Plot spectra, scores, and matches for better insights.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to use X-Spectra:

- `astropy==7.0.1`
- `astroquery==0.4.9.post1`
- `imageio==2.37.0`
- `matplotlib==3.10.1`
- `numpy==2.2.5`
- `pandas==2.2.3`
- `scipy==1.15.2`
